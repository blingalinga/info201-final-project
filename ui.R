    p("There is an abundance of issues contributing to global warming, one of the them being rising CO2 levels in our atmosphere. CO2 is known to absorb less heat than other greenhouse gasses, however, it is also known to be more abundant and stay in our atmosphere for much longer. The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is responsible for a significant portion of the total energy imbalance that is causing Earth's temperatures to rise. This led our group to consider analyzing the trends and implications of atmospheric CO2 emissions over time. In the analysis of our project, we plan to determine the rate of change of CO2 levels over time as well as their aggregate levels. Additionally, we plan to explore the average change and whether or not there are any trends in CO2 levels through different timespans from 1958-2018. This investigation of CO2 data will also determine when CO2 levels were the highest within the time period of the dataset. Another question we plan to address is what impact these trends in CO2 emissions have on Earth and our society. Environmental Health is a large concern during recent times and the continuous emissions of CO2 into our atmosphere will eventually contribute to irreversible damage and conducting this environmental analysis will better inform ourselves as well as our peers on the trends over time, and hopefully educate decisions to live more sustainable lives."),

The method of data collection over time may have changed due to developing filtration and measurement technologies. This data is collected by sampling the air atop the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa and the CO2 levels are monitored mainly through the use of spectroscopy. This data was collected since the 1950s for the purpose of monitoring atmospheric CO2, these measurements can reflect truths about the global atmosphere. In our data, there are 727 observations collected beginning in 1958. This data also has 5 unique columns including date/decimal date, average CO2 PPM, interpolated, trend, and number of days. This dataset contains data about our atmospheric CO2 trends which would affect the population on a global scale but a question a power we could consider is how certain countries have resources to respond to the trends that can be seen in the dataset while some countries may lack the same resources. Limitations to this data set include one location for sampling. The data found here only considers CO2 levels measured a a single location(Mauna Loa) and it is possible that the levels vary in various locations despite being atmospheric levels."),

    p("Challenges and limitations that might arise during our project relating to the trends in CO2 emissions reading over time would be interpreting the levels that would have effects towards the environment such as global temperature increasing resulting in snow and ice to melt making water levels increase around the coast of many countries. Additionally wildlife being affected by this due to suitable temperature zones has changed due to an increase in global temperature and possible extinction to many species. Lastly we also look at human health implications and drawbacks to our health from the CO2 emissions. As our field of focus does not specialize in this realm so we would have to utilize external resources to get a grasp of this section of interpretation of the data. Another limitation that we face in this project is the location of the data collection (Mauna Loa) which does not account for the emission readings across the world which limits the generalizations we can make globally."),
    h2("Implications"),
    p("CO2 emissions, according to NASA, are the leading cause of climate change, which through global warming, shortened harvest seasons, and more extreme weather, has significantly harmful effects on the quality of life on Earth. By identifying the causes that lead to potential increases in CO2 emissions, we hope that this dataset can spark some level of urgency in policymakers across all levels of government. Furthermore, with this dataset, city planners and civil engineers can redesign cities throughout the United States to decrease the overreliance on private vehicles, one of the largest contributors to CO2 emissions in the country. Because the United States is the second largest contributor to CO2 emissions, only after China, and while recognizing trends in CO2 emissions in just the U.S. may lead to solutions on a local scale, our government overhauling our policies on energy such that we rely less on fossil fuels would speak volumes to the rest of the world, which would also likewise be a stepping stone to reduce climate change.")

  p("Since we are dealing with CO2 emission reading and interpretation since 1958 we can observe the correlation of emissions to environmental and health outcomes. In 1950 the world emitted 6 billion tonnes of CO2, meanwhile, we emit about 34 billion tonnes each year in the past decade.1 This is vital since we can compare the data to fossil fuel usage and see that it is the main reason for the spike in emissions into the atmosphere. This increase in CO2 in the atmosphere has led to a .14 degree Fahrenheit increase each decade since 1880.2 The amount of increase does seem small but since Earth is so large it needs more energy to be generated to increase the temperature. In perspective, the 10 warmest years that have been recorded have occurred since 2005 and the small amount of increased temperature could be a large factor in the changes that we have observed. Although the amount of temperature change seems minimal, there have been drawbacks and projected drawbacks. Normal levels of CO2 are 400-1,000 ppm; anything above that range will cause drowsiness, headaches, nausea, increased heart rate, and over time could lead to serious health outcomes.3 As we monitor emission trends from 1958-2018 that has already impacted our planet and eventually will reach a point where the damages are irreversible consider the outcomes that are caused by these emissions.
